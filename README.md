# Connect-4 Solver
 A simple program designed to optimize an enemy AI in Connect-4 using adversarial reinforcement learning.

 Plan:
 - Pit two deep neural networks against each other in a game of Connect-4
 - Reward: win the game
 - Ideally, the neural nets will stumble upon desired behavior, because a Connect-4 board is relatively difficult to fill, without causing a winner to emerge

Purpose:
- Machine learning is cool as hell
- I like Connect-4 and want to see if I can train an neural net that can face a standard minimax algorithm
